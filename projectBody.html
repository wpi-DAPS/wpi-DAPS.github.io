			<h2> Project Description</h2>
			<p>
				The goal of our project is to create an above-knee lower-limb prosthetic socket that is able to adjust the interior socket volume depending on the current activity of the user to optimize comfort, residual limb health, and lower limb control. Smart variable geometry sockets have shown promise in addressing volume fluctuations by lining the socket with fluid-filled bladders to increase or decrease socket volume dependent on limb size. Compression/Release Stabilized (CRS) sockets have shown that smaller areas of higher pressure produce a better fit and increased user safety. We will utilize key aspects of both prosthetic technologies to create a socket that is more supportive, responsive, and better fitting.

				The proposed device will actively monitor user activity with EMG sensors and limb volume with pressure sensors. Sensor information will feed into a microcontroller on a custom PCB. This microcontroller will control linear drivers attached to syringes. These syringes will be directly attached to the bladders. Bladder adjustment is fully automated except for some safety features. There are few commercial sockets with bladders due difficulty of retaining control in an emergency. During any emergencies, our manual fluid release valve will retain user control until a safe position is reached.<br>
